# Project-DataScience

In this repository, I share some of my projects and codes on which I worked on during one year of my MSc. in Data Science and Analytics. This repository primarily comprises of Data Science and Machine Laerning projects. 

The repository includes the following- 

1) <a href="https://github.com/suanshs/Project-DataScience/tree/master/Big%20Data%20Tools">Big Data Tools</a> - Here I share all the projects related to Big Data tools like Hadoop, Spark, Pig, Map Reduce and Hive etc.

2) <a href="https://github.com/suanshs/Project-DataScience/tree/master/ML-Algorithms">Machine Learning Algorithms</a> - Here I share all the machine laerning algorithms implemented using R and Python from scratch.

3) <a href="https://github.com/suanshs/Project-DataScience/tree/master/Parallelization%20of%20Linear%20Regression"> - Parallelization of Linear Regression</a> - In this project I parallelized the widely used linear regression algorithm.

4) <a href="https://github.com/suanshs/Project-DataScience/tree/master/Digit%20Recognizer%20Kaggle">Digit Recognizer</a> - In this project, I built a digit recognizer used to identify digits from handwritten images using MLP and CNN.
