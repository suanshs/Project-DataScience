## Digit Recognizer
Digit Recognizer is an Computer Vision based project. I am using Kaggle digit recognizer data set available at https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data . The project aims at correctly identifying the digits from handwritten images. In this project I am using Multi Layer Perceptron and Convolution Neural Networks and am comparing the performance of both the models.
