## Machine Laearning(ML) Algorithms

Here I share some of the algorithms which I implemented from scratch (not using the libraries like tensorflow, sklearn, keras etc.). The purpose of implementing these algorithms from scratch is to learn the nuances of these algorithms which we might not be able to come across while using the libraries or built-in tools.

This section includes the implementation of some of the commonly used algorithms like:-

1) <a href="https://github.com/suanshs/Project-DataScience/tree/master/ML-Algorithms/Hidden%20Markov%20Models">Hidden Markov Models</a>

2) <a href="https://github.com/suanshs/Project-DataScience/tree/master/ML-Algorithms/K-Means">K-Means Clustering</a>

3) <a href="https://github.com/suanshs/Project-DataScience/tree/master/ML-Algorithms/Multi-Layer%20Perceptron">Multilayer Perceptron</a>

4) <a href="https://github.com/suanshs/Project-DataScience/tree/master/ML-Algorithms/Online%20K-Means%20ART%20SOM">Online K-Means, Adaptive Resonance Theory and Slef Organizing Map</a>
